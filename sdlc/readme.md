# 📘 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) – Complete Guide

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** defines **how software is planned, designed, developed, tested, deployed, and maintained**.

Every application — websites, mobile apps, APIs, enterprise systems — follows SDLC in some form.

Understanding SDLC is **mandatory before learning DevOps**, because **DevOps exists to improve and automate SDLC**.

## 🎯 Objectives of This Document

By the end of this document, you will understand:

- What SDLC is and why it exists
- All stages of SDLC in detail
- Inputs and outputs of each stage
- Different SDLC models and how they work
- Advantages and disadvantages of each model
- How Agile and DevOps improve SDLC
- How SDLC works in real-world DevOps projects

---

## 1️⃣ What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a **structured process** used to:

- Plan software
- Design software
- Develop software
- Test software
- Deploy software
- Maintain software

📌 SDLC provides **discipline, predictability, and quality** to software development.

---

## 2️⃣ Why SDLC is Needed

### Without SDLC
- No clear requirements
- Poor design
- Late bug detection
- Failed deployments
- High production issues

### With SDLC
- Clear workflow
- Defined responsibilities
- Better quality
- Predictable releases
- Easier maintenance

---

## 3️⃣ High-Level SDLC Flow

A modern SDLC looks like this:

```

Plan → Design → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

```

Each stage has a **clear purpose and output**.

---

## 4️⃣ SDLC Stages (Brief Overview)

| Stage | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Planning | Decide what to build |
| Design | Decide how to build |
| Development | Write the code |
| Build | Package the application |
| Testing | Validate functionality |
| Release | Prepare for deployment |
| Deployment | Run in environment |
| Operations | Keep system running |
| Monitoring | Observe and improve |

---

## 5️⃣ SDLC Models – Overview

An **SDLC model** defines **how these stages are executed and repeated**.

Different projects require different SDLC models.

Common SDLC models:
- Waterfall Model
- Agile Model
- Iterative Model
- Spiral Model
- V-Model

---

## 6️⃣ Waterfall Model

### How Waterfall Works

Waterfall is a **sequential model** where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

```

Plan → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy → Maintain

```

### Characteristics
- One phase at a time
- No going back easily
- Heavy documentation
- Changes are costly

### Advantages
- Simple to understand
- Clear milestones
- Good for fixed requirements

### Disadvantages
- Very slow
- No flexibility
- Late testing
- High risk of failure

### Where It Is Used
- Government projects
- Legacy systems
- Projects with fixed scope

📌 **Waterfall is NOT suitable for modern DevOps-heavy environments.**

---

## 7️⃣ Agile Model

### How Agile Works

Agile follows **iterative development** using small cycles called **sprints**.

```

Plan → Develop → Test → Release
↑________________↓
Repeat

```

Each sprint delivers a **small working feature**.

### Characteristics
- Short development cycles
- Continuous feedback
- Frequent releases
- High collaboration

### Advantages
- Flexible to changes
- Faster feedback
- Lower risk
- Better customer satisfaction

### Disadvantages
- Requires discipline
- Less documentation
- Needs experienced teams

### Where It Is Used
- Most modern companies
- Startups
- Cloud-native applications

📌 **Agile + DevOps is the most common modern approach.**

---

## 8️⃣ Iterative Model

### How Iterative Model Works

Software is built **incrementally**, improving with each iteration.

```

Build → Review → Improve → Build → Review → Improve

```

### Characteristics
- Software evolves gradually
- Early versions are basic
- Feedback-driven improvements

### Advantages
- Early delivery
- Risk reduction
- Continuous improvement

### Disadvantages
- Requires good planning
- Can lead to scope creep

### Where It Is Used
- Large systems
- Applications with evolving requirements

---

## 9️⃣ Spiral Model

### How Spiral Model Works

Spiral model focuses on **risk analysis** at every iteration.

```

Plan → Risk Analysis → Develop → Test → Review → Repeat

```

### Characteristics
- Risk-driven approach
- Combines Waterfall + Iterative
- Heavy planning

### Advantages
- Excellent for high-risk projects
- Early identification of risks

### Disadvantages
- Complex
- Expensive
- Not suitable for small projects

### Where It Is Used
- Banking systems
- Critical enterprise applications

---

## 🔟 V-Model (Verification & Validation)

### How V-Model Works

Each development stage has a **corresponding testing stage**.

```

Requirements → Design → Code
↓           ↓        ↓
Test       Test     Test

```

### Characteristics
- Testing planned early
- Strong validation focus

### Advantages
- High quality
- Early testing

### Disadvantages
- Rigid
- Hard to change requirements

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Traditional SDLC vs Modern SDLC

| Aspect | Traditional | Modern (Agile + DevOps) |
|---|---|---|
| Flexibility | Low | High |
| Automation | Low | High |
| Feedback | Late | Continuous |
| Releases | Infrequent | Frequent |
| Risk | High | Lower |

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ How DevOps Improves SDLC

DevOps enhances SDLC by:
- Automating build and deployment
- Enabling Continuous Integration (CI)
- Enabling Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
- Using Infrastructure as Code
- Providing fast feedback via monitoring

```

Plan → Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor
↑__________________________________↓
Continuous Feedback

```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ SDLC in Real-World DevOps Projects

A practical DevOps SDLC flow:

```

Developer writes code →
Code pushed to Git →
CI pipeline builds & tests →
Artifact created →
Infrastructure provisioned →
Application deployed →
System monitored →
Feedback improves next release

```

---

## ⭐ Key Takeaways

- SDLC defines **how software is built**
- Different SDLC models suit different projects
- Agile is the most common modern SDLC model
- DevOps does NOT replace SDLC — it **improves it**
- Understanding SDLC is critical for DevOps engineers

---

🚀 **Once SDLC is clear, DevOps tools become easy to understand and apply.**
